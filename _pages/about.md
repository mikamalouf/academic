## About

My name is Mika Malouf, also known as Chelsea Malouf or Chelsea M. Malouf, and I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Joint PhD programme for LSHTM and Nagasaki University.


## Research Interests

My research focuses on expanding on the current use of multi-pathogen and multi-antigen multiplex serology using datasets from sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia to interpret the following:
1. Methods best describing the sero-prevalence of multiple pathogens in a population without the presence of control data
2. Create a framework in how to interpret multi-pathogen multiplex data
3. Predict the geospatial overlap of NTDs and malaria
